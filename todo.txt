1. Time factor (esp: VAR_0204 seems like a very important feature), (whether it is weekday or not)!!!
2. Clean up cities!!!
3. Model Stacking!!! (L2 Logistic Regression, )
4. L1 regression to remove features.
5. if we still have time, which I highly doubt. (add text fields clustering for occupation, very cool R Script applying NLP!)
